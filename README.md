# judicial_watch
A collection of files and one notebook walking through our process testing claims made by Judicial Watch over voter registrations.
If you're not familiar with Python, or you just want to review our process right now, open the Judicial Watch Analysis Methodology.ipynb file to read through everything we did.
You should be able to clone the whole repository and use the files I've provided to test our work. I put in the zip file for one of the population estimates I downloaded from the American Community Survey website. The countypop.csv file is just a cleaned version of those tables.
Finally, the EAVS survey file is loaded up as well as the MIT 2016 election results file. I clean both of those files in the jupyter notebook itself. 

Jan. 21, 2020 at about 5:34 p.m. Realized the original file for presidential election results had failed to upload due to size. Compressed folder and added to this repo.
